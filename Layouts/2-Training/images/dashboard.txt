3rd tile 		- this section, will also show the list of users, online/offline within the community. Both Alfa and Buyers
4th tile 		- leaderboard for the top performing administration with most and least lines match
				- the reason for having this overview of users is for the admin to check and verify if there are enough people to process the documents (the manual booking)
5th tile(right) - section, breakdown of the auto and manually booked vat or lines
				- for a start, more manual booking than automation, eventually it will be all automated if all the rules added.
